A microservice that takes a local file and uploads it onto the server, storing it in a folder designated in dotenv as process.env.ONLINE_STORAGE

Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice

## [Run from repl.it](https://boilerplate-project-filemetadata.hurricanemark.repl.co)

## [Git source](https://github.com/hurricanemark/microservice-file-metadata.git)


## Optionally, clone from [github](https://github.com/hurricanemark/microservice-file-metadata.git) and run from the terminal (regardless, you must setup and configure your own mongodb database in place of my *process.env.ONLINE_STORAGE where you define server side folder name*)!:

npm install

npm start
